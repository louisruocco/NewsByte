# NewsByte

A web scraper that sends an email every morning with the News. 
### Description:

NewsByte will scrape BBC News at 8am everyday. It will then collect headlines with their links and put them on an email, this email will be sent as soon as the data has come through. I find it's a nice way to get the News quickly, without having to open anything else other than whatever email client you use. 

An email sign up front end will be coming soon!
